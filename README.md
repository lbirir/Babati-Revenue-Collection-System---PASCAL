# Babati-Revenue-Collection-System---PASCAL
This was a project which I undertook as my final year project under the Computer Studies subject for my KCSE (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education) in 2006. The project was done in PASCAL which was my first programming language to learn and first project to undertake from requirements analysis to deployment. The project was based on procedural programming which helped me appreciate OOP later on pursuing Computer Science in my undergraduate studies.
